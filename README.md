# RESTful API, Node.js, Express & Sequelize demo app

A functional RESTful API using Node.js and Express, which can transmit data to a Postgres database by utilizing Sequelize to translate JavaScript into equatable SQL commands.

* Getting data flowing from a Node.js and Express web application, to a PostgreSQL database with Sequelize as the O.R.M. 
* Define relationships between models: a sequelize project to assign tasks to particular users which use associations to define that relationship, then query the database based on those associations.

* Use migrations to manage the state of database schemas.
